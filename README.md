# Duinocoin Docker container for Kubernetes

Based on the original [duino coin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) repository I've created a docker file and container in docker hub that allows one to run a duino coin deployment in kubernetes.

If you find any issues, please let me know.

For me it runs on my personal https://turingpi.com/ TPi2 cluster with 4 raspberry Pi CM4 modules.

This build is not intended to be run on other hardware than IoT style hardware.
